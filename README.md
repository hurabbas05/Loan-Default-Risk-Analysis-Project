</p>

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project explores the key factors contributing to **loan defaults** by applying the full data analysis pipeline — from **data cleaning and EDA** to **feature engineering and machine learning modeling**. The objective is to provide **actionable insights** for financial institutions to identify high-risk borrowers and optimize lending strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess loan application data
- Identify patterns and relationships using grouped visualizations
- Apply **feature engineering** techniques for model readiness
- Train and evaluate **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models
- Predict loan status (Default / Non-Default) accurately

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

✅ Cleaned missing values, handled outliers, and transformed skewed distributions  
📊 Created **grouped bar charts** for Age, Income, Loan Amount, etc., vs Loan Status  
🧹 Applied binning, label encoding, and log transformation techniques  
🧠 Built two predictive models:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
🧪 Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision-recall  
🧾 Delivered insights in a clear, visual, and business-focused manner

---

- 📈 **Insightful Findings**  
  - Young and low-income applicants showed higher default risk  
  - Higher loan amounts correlated with more defaults  
  - Loan purpose and home ownership played strong roles


---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Young and low-income applicants show **higher default risk**
- **Loan purpose** like education and medical had elevated default rates
- **Home ownership** status significantly impacted risk levels
- Higher loan amounts → Higher chances of default
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in predicting default cases
